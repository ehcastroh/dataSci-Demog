Even to those who have not read the Clarksdale chapter of <i>Promised Land</i> (of whom there are none among us) -- it will come as no surprise that Black Americans in the US South endured inequality in virtually every sphere of life.  The fact that this is well known should not deter the young data scientist from further explortion.\n", "\n", "In the *second*  lab on the Great Migration,  we will take a look at the characteristics of those who chose to migrate from the south to the north.  Keep that in mind as we investigate conditions in the South because the obvious question that you might be asked is whether the people who sufferred most were the most likely to leave.\n", "\n", "The Census data that we are using today comes to us via the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series project at the University of Minnesota Population Center.

In order to save (a lot of money) IPUMS draws a random sample of 5 percent of households (this is done with the manuscripts of the ancient census returns, of course,  but it functionally the same as if they had selected the dwelling units).  By randomly selecting *households*  rather than *individuals*,  much more useful information is available to us -- things like number of siblings in a household; the characteristics of parents *and* children together; characteristics of dwelling units; and the relationship among people who share a dwelling.\n", "\n", "#### It is worth keeping this in mind as you ponder your final project, as this sort of data is available from IPUMS for lots of times and places.  It also important for our purpose today to understand that the data that we will use today is in what is sometimes knows as \"wide format\"  (as opposed to the \"long format\" data that we worked with in the demographic transition lab).  This means that each row of the table that we read in, will refer to an individual -- it will contain information on lots of things pertaining to that individual, for example,  sex, age, wage income, and edcation.  Each row also contains a variable called \"SERIAL\"  this number uniquely identifies households.  Groups of rows of the table with the same value of SERIAL, are households.  Each person within such a household has a unique PERNUM value which starting with 1.  Within each household, PERNUM is unique for each individual while SERIAL is the same.  All household level variable e.g. dwelling unit characteristics,  will be the same for all members of the household.\n", "\n", "#### In this particular sample (1960, 5 percent) simple random sampling is used -- consequently,  as we noted in the Fertility lab,  this is not always the case with IPUMS.  But this time it is, so we need not worry about weights -- except when we wish to present estimates for the entire population.  If we wanted, for example to know the number of 13 year olds in the population,  we would count them up in our sample and then divide that sum by .05 (or multiply it by 20  whatever).\n", "\n", "## Put your student id in the obvious place and then run the cell below"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "source": ["# Run this cell to import the stuff we'll need\n", "import pandas as pd\n", "import numpy as np\n", "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt \n", "plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')\n", "\n", "%matplotlib inline\n", "from datascience import Table\n", "from datascience.predicates import are\n", "from IPython.display import HTML, IFrame, display\n", "datasite=\"http://courses.demog.berkeley.edu/mason88/data/gmig0/\"\n", "quizsite=\"http://courses.demog.berkeley.edu/mason88/cgi-bin/quiz.py\"\n", "  \n", "def cquiz(qno) : \n", "    import IPython, requests \n", "    try:\n", "        sid\n", "    except NameError: \n", "        print(\"HEY! did you enter your sid way up at the top of this notebook?\")\n", "    Linkit='{0}?qno={1}&sid={2}'.format(quizsite,qno,sid)\n", "    #print(Linkit)\n", "    html = requests.get(Linkit)\n", "    #display(IFrame(Linkit, 1000, 300))\n", "    display(IFrame(Linkit, 1000, 400))\n", "\n", "\n", "    \n", "######################\n", "# Here it is ... the obvious place to put your student id\n", "sid=\"\"\n", "######################\n", "if sid == \"\" :\n", "    print(\"HEY! didn't I tell you to put your sid in the obvious place\")\n", " \n"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["## And as usual indicate with whom you are working this week"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "source": ["cquiz('greatMig0-partners')\n"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["# Background on African American Migration\n", "\n", "1.
