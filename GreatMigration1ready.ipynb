In the first GreatMigration Lab, we looked at the conditions of people (particularly African American people) who *lived* in a southern state.  This week, we will look at people who were *born* in a southern state and we'll compare the characteristics of southern born people who no longer live in the south with those who continue to reside in the state of their birth. In other words we're going to compare *migrants* with non-migrants. To be more tediously precise, we're going to compare the characteristics of migrants with those *at risk of migrating* in other words with the universe of people born in the particular state.\n", "\n", "The data that we will use in this week's exercise is very similar to what we used in the first Great Migration lab.
